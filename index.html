      <h2>HTML</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Angle brackets include everything we want in the element</li>
        <li>HTML elements are case sensitive</li>
        <li>The head element contains information about the webpage</li>
        <li>Title element defines title for webpage- important for SEO</li>
        <li>Style element dfines the CSS styles associated with a webpage</li>
        <li>Base element defines the base URL for a webpage</li>
        <li>Link element connects an external resource to the html document</li>
        <li>Meta element defines metadata such as the character set, description, keywords, author, and view point</li>
        <li>Script element embeds client-side scripts in the html document</li>
        <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user</li>
        <li>h1 through h6 represent page headings- h1 should be main and appear only once</li>
        <li>Semantic HTML Elements- the name of the element that describes its content and the role it plays on the webpage- easy for other developers to read</li>
      </ul>

  <section class="card" id="css-section">
    <h2>CSS</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the ourside of an element</li>
      <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element</li>
      <li>Three ways to style a webpage using CSS</li>
      <li>1- inline CSS: a developer styles an element directly in the HTML file; good for quick and permenent fixes for particular page elements only</li>
      <li>2- internal style sheet: contains css rules for the webpage in the head section of the html file</li>
      <li>3- External css style sheet: most common; preferred  because keeps all css rules in seperate file which makes design changes easier; link the external css style sheet using a link element placed in the html head</li>
      <li>Seperation of Concerns: seperate code into different fiels based on use; idea that each section of code should have its own responsibility</li>
      <li>Selector: defines the element or attributes to which the rules, or declarations, apply</li>
      <li>Declarations: Contain 2 imporatnt components- CSS property we want to aplly and the value of the property</li>
      <li>CSS Box Model: content in middle, then padding, then border, then page margin</li>
      <li>DRY: Do not Repeat Yourself- combind 2 or more selectors into a single css rule with a comma</li>
      <li>an asterisks applies the rule to all visible elements on the page</li>
      <li>Class Attribute: assign the rule to certain elements, not all; put a period mark in front of class selector</li>
    </ul>

  <section class="card" id="git-section">
    <h2>Git</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Repository or repo- every project is called a repo- a folder for your project that contains all of the files and their revision history</li>
      <li>Branch- workspace where you can make changes that do not affect the live site</li>
      <li>Markdown- .md: the way content files are formatted in Github- easily converts to html</li>
      <li>Commit Changes- saving a new version of the file you are working on: whenever you add, edit, delete a file, you are making a commit</li>
      <li>Pull Request- asking for changed on a branch to merge into another branch- ways to discuss and review your work with other</li>
      <li>Merge- Pull in: when a pull request is approved, changes are pulled-in or merged with the main branch</li>
      <li>Issue- Ways to report new task or content fixes- track progress on a project</li>
      <li>Wiki- a section of the repo to store documentation: read me files</li>
      <li>Blocker- stuck on a problem- preventing progress</li>
      <li>Bottleneck- point in development progress that is slowing the rest of production</li>
      <li>git status: checks what branch we are currently on</li>
      <li>git checkout -b branch-name: creates a new branch and switches to it</li>
      <li>Tools Use in the Editorial Process:</li>
      <li>1- Assigning: Github Issues and Projects</li>
      <li>2- Writing and Editing: Word and Google Docs</li>
      <li>3- Producing: Github, Github Desktop, Markdown Text Editor</li>
      <li>4- Publishing: Github and Federalist</li>
      <li>5- Revising: Githubg and Markdown Text Editor</li>
      <li>Process in Github</li>
      <li>1- Create a new branch: make contect changes</li>
      <li>2- Open a pull request: content changes reviewed by others- assign someone to review your work</li>
      <li>3- Merge and Deploy: content changes are approved and published</li>
      <li>General Tips:</li>
      <li>1- Create new branch then switch to local desktop</li>
    </ul>

    <section class="card" id="javascript-section">
      <h2>JavaScript</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code</li>
        <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script</li>
        <li>Used to use the declaration var; now most people use declaration const or let</li>
        <li>Conditional statements and loops control the order in which code is executed</li>
        <li>If statements are a way of introducing decision making into our code; code will only execute if the statement meets a condition or is true</li>
        <li>In JavaScript true is yes; false is no</li>
        <li>Array: a single variable that is used to hold a group of data; typically used to store related data</li>
        <li>In JavaScript words in an array need quotes around each word; numbers and true and false do not need quotations</li>
        <li>Index: unique number to identify and locate a data item in an array</li>
        <li>In JavaScript 0 is always the first number in an array</li>
        <li>For loops: tells the computer to test the data over and over again without mannually doing it; For loops always need 3 important statements</li>
        <li>1- statement to determine the starting point for the loop ex: let x = 0</li>
        <li>2- statment to determine condition; as long as the number in the variable is less than the length of the array, the loop will keep running; ex: x less than symbol shapes.length semicolon</li>
        <li>3- final statement allows the array to iterate over each time; since we know the pattern sequence increases by 1 each time, we use shortcut to add 1; ex: x++</li>
        <li>commenting out makes code inactive without deleting it, in case you need it later</li>
        <li>Function: a set of instructions that tells the computer how to perform a certain task</li>
        <li>Function vs For Loop: functions do not automatically execute when JavaScript files are run; Instead you need to call a function by name to execute it</li>
        <li>The functions declaration is function</li>
      </ul>
